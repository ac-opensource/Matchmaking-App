## For Players
Imagine you're a regular sport player, no funds, no chance of getting into the big leagues? What if you have proof of your games? You build a profile that no one can dispute? You play games and your scores are recorded. This will be your platform.

## For Sports Venues
Have you ever tried booking a place for games but only to be disappointed that it's not available when you get there? What if you can reserve a place just by logging into the app and paying the reservation fee? No need to be physically there. Isn't it easier?

## For Businesses
Imagine you're a sports apparel shop and you want to sell items, what can be a more targeted audience than this? This can also be an advertisement / e-commerce platform.
